NVIDIA Cloud Native Core
========================

NVIDIA Cloud Native Core is a collection of software to run cloud native workloads on NVIDIA GPUs.
NVIDIA Cloud Native Core is based on Ubuntu, Kubernetes, Helm, and the NVIDIA GPU and Network Operators.

This software stack was previously known as "EGX Stack", and is designed to run well on the [NVIDIA EGX Platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/egx/)

In DeepOps 22.01 and before, we included Ansible playbooks for installing and validating the EGX Platform in `playbooks/nvidia-egx`.

Up-to-date Ansible playbooks and install guides for Cloud Native Core can now be found in the [dedicated NVIDIA/cloud-native-core repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cloud-native-core).
