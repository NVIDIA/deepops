# DeepOps Testing, CI/CD, and Validation

## DeepOps Continuous Integration Testing

The DeepOps project leverages a private Jenkins server to run continuous integration tests. Testing is done using the [virtual](../../virtual) deployment mechanism. Several Vagrant VMs are created, the cluster is deployed, tests are executed, and then the VMs are destroyed. 

The goal of the DeepOps CI is to prevent bugs from being introduced into the code base and to identify when changes in 3rd party platforms have occurred or impacted the DeepOps deployment mechanisms. In general, K8s and Slurm deployment issues are detected and resolved with urgency. Many components of DeepOps are 3rd party open source tools that may silently fail or suddenly change without notice. The team will make a best-effort to resolve these issues and include regression tests, however there may be times where a fix is unavailable. Historically, this has been an issue with Rook-Ceph and Kubeflow, and those GitHub communities are best equipped to help with resolutions. 

### Testing Methodi

DeepOps CI contains two types of automated tests:

* Nightly tests. These are more exhaustive and run on a nightly basis against the `master` branch.

* PR tests. These are faster and are executed against every open PR when commits are made to `master`. They are also when a commit is made to any DeepOps branch (`release-20.12`, `master`, etc.). Results are integrated into GitHub.

In addition to the automated tests, we also provide developers the a method to manually kick off a test run against one or more deployment configurations in parallel from the below testing matrix through the [Jenkins-matrix](../../workloads/jenkins/Jenkinsfile-matrix) Jenkinsfile.

### Tests

A short description of the nightly testing is outlined below. The full suit of tests can be reviewed in the [jenkins](../../workloads/jenkins) directory. Additional details can be found [here](../../workloads/jenkins/README.md).

## DeepOps Deployment Validation

The Slurm and Kubernetes deployment guides both document cluster verification steps. These should be run during the installation process to validate a GPU workload can be executed on the cluster.

Additional services such as Kubeflow, Open OnDemand, or Monitoring may have additional validation steps that are documented in the corresponding DeepOps READMEs and the official documentation.

For workloads that can be used as post-deployment validation, see the example workloads for [k8s]( ../../workloads/examples/k8s/) and [slurm]( ../../workloads/examples/slurm).
