# This file is copied to config/maas-inventory.yml by scripts/setup.sh.
# Edit your private copy there (config/ is gitignored).
#
# You can also set MAAS_INVENTORY_CONFIG=/path/to/config.yml or use
# environment variables (MAAS_API_URL, MAAS_API_KEY, etc.).
# Environment variables take precedence over config file values.

# Generate with: sudo maas apikey --username=<your-user>
# Or find in MAAS web UI: your profile -> API keys

# SSH bastion/jumpbox for ProxyJump (optional)
# Only needed if target machines are on a private network that requires
# jumping through a bastion host. Leave commented out for direct access.
