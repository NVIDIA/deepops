# Your custom playbooks should go in your DeepOps configuration directory,
# under `config/playbooks`.
# 
# These playbooks can be used to make any customizations to your cluster
# that aren't already provided by DeepOps!
# For example, this playbook installs `cowsay` on all your Kubernetes nodes.
#
# For more details on how to write Ansible playbooks, see the Ansible
# documentation:
#   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html
