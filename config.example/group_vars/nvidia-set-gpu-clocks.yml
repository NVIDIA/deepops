# Variables for the nvidia-set-gpu-clocks.yml playbook

gpu_clock_reset: no
# Resets the Gpu clocks to the default values. (see the `--reset-gpu-clocks` flag in nvidia-smi for more)

gpu_clock_lock: "1507,1507"
# Specifies <minGpuClock,maxGpuClock> clocks as a pair (e.g. 1500,1500) that defines the range of desired locked GPU clock speed in MHz. Setting this will supercede application clocks and take effect regardless if an app is running. Input can also be a singular desired clock value. (see the `--lock-gpu-clocks` flag in nvidia-smi for more)
