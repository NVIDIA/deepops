# This yaml file will launch a container onto any node that has a nvidia.com/gpu resource
# This container could potentially be deployed on a NVIDIA A100, V100, T4, or any other GPU type
# If a node is configured with mig-strategy=single, this container could potentially run with a MIG device
#
# This deployment style is unpredictable in a heterogenous cluster and should not be used
