# While we would prefer to use the Ansible helm module, it's broken! :-(
# See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/57897
# Unfortunately this will not be fixed until Ansible 2.10 which is not yet released.
# So for now we will run helm commands directly...

- name: install nvidia k8s gpu feature discovery helm repo
  command: /usr/local/bin/helm repo add nvgfd "{{ k8s_gpu_feature_discovery_helm_repo }}"

- name: update helm repos
  command: /usr/local/bin/helm repo update

- name: install nvidia k8s gpu feature discovery
