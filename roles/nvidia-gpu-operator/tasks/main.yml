# While we would prefer to use the Ansible helm module, it's broken! :-(
# See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/57897
# Unfortunately this will not be fixed until Ansible 2.10 which is not yet released.
# So for now we will run helm commands directly...

- name: install gpu-operator helm repo
  command: helm repo add nvidia "{{ gpu_operator_helm_repo }}"

- name: update helm repos
  command: helm repo update

- name: install nvidia gpu operator
  command: helm upgrade --install "{{ gpu_operator_release_name }}" "{{ gpu_operator_chart_name }}" --version "{{ gpu_operator_chart_version }}" --wait
