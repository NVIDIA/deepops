# Many provisioning systems, especially for Ubuntu, will include cloud-init
# as part of the initial setup process for networking and other configuration.
#
# However, DeepOps attempts to manage many of the same files, which can lead to
# conflicts and some components breaking under certain circumstances. /etc/hosts
# is a good example of a file that both systems try to manage.
#
# This playbook disables cloud-init to prevent DeepOps and cloud-init from
# stepping on each other.
