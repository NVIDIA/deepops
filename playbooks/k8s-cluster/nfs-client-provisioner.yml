# This playbook is used to setup the nfs-client-provisioner
# If the cluster already has an nfs server setup run with --skip-tags="nfs_server,nfs_mkdir"
#   Otherwhise an NFS server will be configured on kube-master[0] 
# After settting up an NFS server, nfs software is installed on all nodes
# Lastly, the nfs-client-provisioner is helm installed using the role
#
# TODO: This uses a local submodule because 'stable' is EOL and a new repo is not yet up
#
# The default NFS configuration of this playbook is not meant for production systems
#   For production deployments please configur NFS with storage-partner guidance
#
# Install the required NFS software on all nodes and then helm install the nfs-client
